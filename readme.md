#Task for an Internship

Hello,

- I have used Block Element Modifier methodology for naming classes in index.html.

- For layout I used responsive float grid.

- I have finished the given task as I followed design from .psd files.

- I haven't used bootstrap or any icon pack, for icon I have used images from .psd design.

- I have used gulp, an open-source JavaScript toolkit to compile scss to css , gulp-babel to compile JS es6 to es5.

- CSS files and JS files are minified by gulp-uglify.





Instructions:
  1. npm install - install all dependencies
  2. gulp - compilation(.scss - .css and .js es6-es5), minifying(.css and .js), watch for changes in HTML, JS or SCSS
